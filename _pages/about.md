## Kalie is a Nuclear Engineering PhD student at UC Berkeley interested in radiation detection for applications in nuclear safeguards, security, and nonproliferation.

# Technical Experience
I am early in my PhD career, so I am currently focusing on coursework. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Nuclear Engineering from The University of Tennessee. During undergrad, I interned at Oak Ridge and Argonne National Labs and Dominion Energy. I was also an undergraduate research and teaching assistant in my department. 

# Leadership Experience
I am passionate about supporting women in STEM, and one way I follow this passion is through involvement with professional societies like The Society of Women Engineers (SWE).
